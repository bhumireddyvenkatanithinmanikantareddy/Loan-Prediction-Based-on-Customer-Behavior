# Loan-Prediction-Based-on-Customer-Behavior
This project aims to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan using historical data on customer behavior. By analyzing features such as income, age, experience, marital status, and other socio-economic indicators, the project identifies potential risk factors associated with loan default.
